﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Abstract========Television suppliers must register television appliances, which are to be soldin Australia and New Zealand, with the Australian government. The preferredattributes of the registered television appliances such as screen size, powerconsumption and technology (e.g. LCD, Plasma, OLED, etc.) plays an importantrole in deciding which combination of attributes are favorable for theAustralian and New Zealand consumers. The purpose of this report is toinvestigate the relationship between the physical attribute of televisionappliances (screen size, power consumption and technology) and their associatedenergy ratings. The dataset used in the analyses, as obtained from theAustralian government, contains all the television appliances registered betweenApril 2013 to January 2018 for sale in Australia and New Zealand. This datasetwas processed, interpreted, analyzed and visualized utilizing the R analyticalprogramming language. This report sheds light on the preferred combination ofattributes (screen size, technology, power consumption and energy rating index)of the television appliances that are registered by the suppliers. The reportalso highlights an interesting relationship between power consumption and energyrating index. This report may influence the way consumers decide to choosebetween television appliances based on information and insight that arecontained in the report.*Keywords*: Analysis, R, Energy Rating Index, Screen size, Power consumption,Brand, Television ApplianceIntroduction============According to ACMA [1], twenty nine percent of households had purchased a newtelevision set in the 12 months before the *ACMA media release 46/2012 - 20June* study, and 70 per cent had bought a new set in the three years prior tothe study. With the advent of new television technologies such as LCD, Plasma,OLED and LCD (LED), increased screen sizes and various smart TV capabilities, ithas become difficult for the average consumer to understand where the costbenefits are for the new television appliances. There seem to be a generalmisconception amongst consumers as to how different television appliances thatconsists of different attributes relates to price and energy ratings. Consumersseems to think that there is a linear correlation between television appliancespower consumption and their associated energy index ratings. It is this latteraspect that has motivated me to find out what the true relationship is betweenthe various attributes of television appliances, especially the relationshipbetween power consumption, screen size, technology and energy ratings.Data====All suppliers are obligated by law to register household appliances, which areto be sold in Australia and New Zealand, with the Australian government. Thedata for these registered household appliances is made available by theAustralian Government [2]. These datasets are regularly updated by theAustralian Government but, for this report a specific registered, **televisionappliances** dataset was downloaded from the URL as specified in [3]. Thedatafile is in **csv** (comma-separated-variable) file format. The datasetcontains 3381 entries of registered television appliances. A total number of 31variables are captured per record of which 19 are of type Factor (17 – CategoricNominal, 2 - Date), 12 of type Numerical (11 – Numeric,1 - Integer). There wasno prior intervention on the dataset and the dataset was utilized and consumedas downloaded.Methods-------The R-Studio software application (Version: 1.1.383) was used to download andprocess the television appliance dataset. Functions from the *cluster,tidyverse* and *dplyr* libraries were utilized to explore, analyze, evaluate,filter, tidy, transform, summarize and visualize the dataset. Of the 31available variables only 6 variables, as listed in [A1] (4 of type Numerical and2 of type Categoric - Nominal), were deemed necessary for the analysis process.The rest of the variables were discarded. The screen size variable was convertedfrom centimeters (as measured diagonally) to inches - this falls more in linewith consumer understanding of television screen sizes. The technology variablehas 4 possible values: Plasma, LCD, LCD (LED) and OLED. These values are treatedas nominal. The SRI (Star Rating Index) variable was rescaled to a value in therange [1:6], which corresponds to the consumer industry star rating standard.Unnecessarily long brand names were shortened to be better displayed in ggplot2visualizations. All records containing empty values were discarded. The numericvariables Active Power and Standby Power were rounded to two decimal points. Atotal of 3115 records remained after the original dataset was filtered andmissing value records were imputed. See **A – R Code** for associated R codelistings.A summary of the dataset is listed in [A2]. A Gower’s dissimilarity matrix wascreated and then a heatmap was generated from that. The generated heatmap [A3]revealed some interesting clusters, which probably points to the demarcationboundaries between certain technology types of the registered televisions.Group based data summarization are listed in [A4] and [A5]. The *select*function in base R as well as the *groupby* and *arrange* functions from the*dplyr* library were used to filter, group and arrange the dataset in thesesummarizations. Lastly, *ggplot* was used to create visual presentations(scatter plots, box plot and line plots) of the following variables: Screen sizevs. Active Power, Screen size vs. Energy Rating Index and Technology vs. EnergyRating Index. The scatterplots were overlaid with line plots, which were derivedas linear regression models. The *lm* function in base R was utilized for theregression models.Results and Discussion----------------------A summary of the dataset [A2] reveals that LG, Samsung and Panasonic are thethree suppliers who registered the greatest number of television appliances,i.e. a total of 1161. Of the four registered technologies, the LCD (LED)technology was by far the leading technology for registered televisionappliances with a total of 2656. The average screen size was 46.2 inches, theaverage active power consumption was 75.96 Watts and the average energy ratingwas 3.72.The heatmaps for the dataset [A3] illustrates some interesting clusters andprobably coincide with the different technologies and screen sizes. Thegroup-based summarization in [A4] indicates that the 55-inch screen size was thetop screen size registered with a total of 539. Interestingly, the 65-inchscreen size was the third most registered screen size after the 32-inch. Due tothe popularity of the 65-inch screen size one would think that the 60-inchscreen size should be equally sought after but, the 60-inch screen sizeappliances ranks only 8th with a total of 109 appliances registered. Thegroup-based summarization in [A5] indicates that the LCD (LED) is overwhelminglypopular as a technology with Samsung and LG dominating the registration listwith their 55-inch, 32-inch and 65-inch LCD (LED) appliances.The scatterplot in [A6] illustrates the direct linear relationship betweenscreen size and active power consumption. This is to be expected, as more pixelsobviously requires more power. This trend holds true for all 4 technologies. Thescatterplot in [A7] suggest a very weak linear inverse relationship betweenscreen size and energy rating index. One would expect that energy efficiencydrops linearly for increasing screen sizes because, more pixels consumes moreenergy. However, the scatterplots in [A6] and [A7] suggests otherwise. Thescatterplot in [A7] also indicates that there are a wide range of screen sizesregistered for each energy rating index.Lastly, the boxplot in [A8] illustrates the different technologies vs. energyrating index. From the plot one can deduce that both LCD and LCD (LED)technologies have, on average, a higher energy rating index and therefore aremore energy efficient technologies.Conclusion----------The disparity that is illustrated between the scatterplots in [A6] and [A7]correlates well with the advice given by Australian government’s Energy Ratingwebsite, under the section *The Energy Rating Label on Television* [4]. Thismeans that the energy rating star system is meant to be used to comparetelevision appliances of the same screen size. E.g. when a consumer choosesbetween two 55-inch screens, which both have the same attributes but, the onehas an energy star rating of 5 and the other has an energy star rating of 3.Then, the consumer should choose the one with the energy star rating of 5, asthis one would be the more energy efficient 55-inch appliance. This is how theenergy star rating system is meant to work. Therefore, the opposite then holdstrue – a consumer cannot use the energy star rating index to compare a 32-inchLCD screen with an energy star rating index of 3 stars, with a 65-inch LCDtelevision with an energy star rating index of 5 stars. By design, there is nopossible way for a 65-inch LCD screen to consume less power than a 32-inch LCDscreen. Furthermore, from the results it is obvious that suppliers areregistering an overwhelmingly higher number LCD (LED) technology driventelevision appliances with screen sizes of 55-inches. To the consumer, thisshould be a clear indication that the greatest price competition point will beon this joint front. Therefore, the average consumer will most likely find thebest value for money by looking at 55-inch LCD (LED) television appliances.Then, lastly, the consumer can compare the energy ratings the 55-inch LCD (LED)appliances to find the one which is most power efficient. Both those criteriacould enable the consumer to find good value for money in terms of technology,screen size and power consumption.Appendix 1==========Table - Selected variables from original dataset| **Variable**   | **Type**            | **Description**                                                                   ||----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Brand_Reg      | Categoric - Nominal | This is the manufacturers brand                                                   || screensize     | Numerical           | The diagonal measurement of the screen in cm                                      || Screen_Tech    | Categoric - Nominal | This is the type of screen technology (LCD, Plasma, OLED, etc…)                   || Act_stnd_power | Numerical           | This is the time allocated that the television will be in active standby mode.    || Avg_mode_power | Numerical           | This is the amount of energy used by the appliance when the television is in use. || SRI            | Numerical           | The current Star Rating Index for the appliance.                                  |Appendix 2==========```summary(Data_2)```Table - Summary of cleansed dataset![](./media/summary_pic.PNG)Appendix 3==========```Dist \<- daisy(Data_2, metric = "gower")Dist \<- as.matrix(Dist)dim \<- ncol(Dist) \# used to define axis in imageheatmap(Dist, Rowv=TRUE, Colv="Rowv", symm = TRUE)```Figure – Generated Heatmap![](./media/heatmap.png)----------------------------------------Appendix 4==========```Data_2 %\>%group_by(Screensize) %\>%summarise(N = n(), mean(Active_PWR), mean(Energy_Rating_Index)) %\>%arrange(desc(N)) %\>%head(10)```Table – Top 10 screen sizes registered![](./media/topregisteredbrands.PNG)Appendix 5==========```Data_2 %\>%group_by(Brand, Technology, Screensize) %\>%summarise(N = n()) %\>%arrange(desc(N)) %\>%head(10)```Table – Top 10 brands registered technologies by screen size![](./media/brandvstechnology.PNG)Appendix 6==========```ggplot(data = Data_2) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Screensize, y = Active_PWR,color = Technology)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = Screensize, y = Active_PWR,color = Technology), method = "lm", se = FALSE) + xlab("Screensize (diagonal -inches)") +ylab("Active Power(W)") + ggtitle("Scatterplot - Screensize vs. Active Power ")```Figure – Screen size (inches) vs. Active Power (W)![](media/249d3830b56e00c780be1b9e23c29d90.png)Appendix 7==========```ggplot(data = Data_2) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Screensize, y =Energy_Rating_Index, color = Technology)) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x =Screensize, y = Energy_Rating_Index, color = Technology), method = "lm", se =FALSE) + xlab("Screensize (diagonal - inches)") +ylab("Energy Rating Index") + ggtitle("Scatterplot - Screensize vs. EnergyRating Index ")```Figure – Screen size (inches) vs. Energy Rating Index (1:6)![](media/e9f0a40342c3269db15a1a1ff2462afa.png)Appendix 8==========```ggplot(data = Data_2, mapping = aes(x = Technology, y = Energy_Rating_Index)) +geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 3) + geom_jitter(width =0.1, alpha = 0.05, color = "blue") + xlab("Technology") + ylab("Energy RatingIndex") +ggtitle("Boxplot - Technology vs. Energy Rating Index")```![](media/8ef97e1c4518220605d84f05b24dc8be.png)References==========1.
